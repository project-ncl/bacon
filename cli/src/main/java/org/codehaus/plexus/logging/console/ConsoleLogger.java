/**
 * Massive hack to override the default plexus logging implementation, ConsoleLogger, is adapted to Slf4j, rather than
 * the actual implementation that just prints to stdout
 * <p/>
 * All credit for this genius idea goes to Mr David Walluck (@dwalluck)
 * <p/>
 * Our license generator (snowdrop licenses) uses Maven core under the hood for its business. Unfortunately, the
 * DefaultProjectBuilder from Maven core uses Plexus Logger, with default implementation ConsoleLogger (I couldn't find
 * a way to tell maven to use a different implementation). The ConsoleLogger implementation is rather primitive and just
 * prints to stdout.
 * <p/>
 * This is not OK because we'd like all of our logging to be controlled by slf4j. More specifically, right now we want
 * all of our logs to go to stderr, not stdout.
 * <p/>
 * This re-implementation replaces the default one to use Slf4j for logging instead.
