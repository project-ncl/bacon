Licensing
---------

SRP is royalty-free worldwide for commercial and non-commercial use.
The SRP library has been carefully written not to depend on any
encumbered algorithms, and it is distributed under a standard
BSD-style Open Source license which is shown below.  This license
covers implementations based on the SRP library as well as
independent implementations based on RFC 2945.

The SRP distribution itself contains algorithms and code from
various freeware packages; these parts fall under both the SRP
Open Source license and the packages' own licenses.  Care has
been taken to ensure that these licenses are compatible with
Open Source distribution, but it is the responsibility of the
licensee to comply with the terms of these licenses.  This
disclaimer also applies to third-party libraries that may be
linked into the distribution, since they may contain patented
intellectual property.  The file "Copyrights" contains a list
of the copyrights incorporated by portions of the software.

Broader use of the SRP authentication technology, such as variants
incorporating the use of an explicit server secret (SRP-Z), may
require a license; please contact the Stanford Office of Technology
Licensing (http://otl.stanford.edu/) for more information about
terms and conditions.
