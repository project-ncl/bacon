<h2>License Compatibility and Relicensing</h2>

<address class="byline">by Richard Stallman</address>

<p>If you want to combine two free programs into one, or merge code from
one into the other, this raises the question of whether their licenses
allow combining them, or prohibit combining them.<a href="#f1">[1]</a></p>

<p>There is no problem merging programs that have the same license, if it
is a reasonably behaved license, as nearly all free licenses
are.<a href="#f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>What then when the licenses are different?  In general we say that
several licenses are <em>compatible</em> if there is a way to merge
code under those various licenses while complying with all of them.
The result, often, is a program with parts under various different
compatible licenses&mdash;but not always.  Such combinability, or the
absence of it, is a characteristic of a given set of licenses, and is
not dependent on what order you mention them in.  The set of licenses
also controls which license is required for the combined program.</p>

<p>We divide licenses into three classes: lax (also
&ldquo;permissive&rdquo; or &ldquo;pushover&rdquo;), intermediate, and
copyleft.  A lax license does nothing to interfere with putting the
code into proprietary software.  A copyleft license prohibits that, by
requiring all reuse to be in programs under the same license.  An
intermediate license puts some conditions on adding proprietary code
but does not try to prohibit it.</p>

<p>In general, lax permissive licenses (modified BSD, X11, Expat, Apache,
Python, etc.) are compatible with each other.  That's because they
have no requirements about other code that is added to the program.
They even permit putting the entire program (perhaps with changes)
into a proprietary software product; thus, we call them
&ldquo;pushover licenses&rdquo; because they can't say
&ldquo;no&rdquo; when one user tries to deny freedom to others.</p>

<p>In a combination of programs under lax licenses, each part carries the
license it came with.  When the code is merged to the point that the
parts can't be distinguished any more, that merged code should carry
all the licenses of the merged parts.  Since all the licenses are lax
anyway, this causes no practical problem except that the list of
licenses gets long.<a href="#f3">[3]</a></p>

<p>By the same token, lax licenses are usually compatible with any
copyleft license.  In the combined program, the parts that came in
under lax licenses still carry them, and the combined program as a
whole carries the copyleft license.  One lax license, Apache 2.0, has
patent clauses which are incompatible with GPL version 2; since I
think those patent clauses are good, I made GPL version 3 compatible
with them.</p>

<p>The one important exception is the original BSD license, because of
the &ldquo;obnoxious advertising clause.&rdquo;  This condition required a
specific notice in <em>all</em> advertising of <em>any</em> product
containing <em>any</em> code released under the original BSD license.
This was, and is, incompatible with all actual copyleft licenses.  It
was also a pain in the neck for every distro, as programs accumulated
with similar but different advertising requirements.  At one point, a
BSD distro required over 70 different notices.</p>

<p>I mostly eliminated this problem by convincing a dean, Hal Varian, to
arrange for UC Berkeley to publish the &ldquo;modified BSD
license&rdquo; (without the advertising clause) and rerelease the code
of the Berkeley System Distribution under that.  Nowadays the original
BSD license is (fortunately) rarely used, but we must still take care
<a href="/licenses/bsd.html">not to talk about &ldquo;the&rdquo; BSD
license</a>.</p>

<p>In general, two different copyleft licenses are unavoidably
incompatible unless they have explicit compatibility provisions.  This
is not due to a mistake in the details; it's inherent in the idea of
copyleft.  The idea of copyleft is that &ldquo;Modified and extended
versions must be under the same license.&rdquo; If license A (on
program P) says extended programs must be under license A, and license
B (on program Q) says extended programs must be under license B, they
have an irreconcilable disagreement; the license of the combined
program which includes code from P plus code from Q would have to be
A, <em>and</em> it would have to be B.</p>

<p>This is why GPL version 2 is
incompatible with GPL version 3; it could not be avoided.  Likewise,
the conditions of CC-BY-SA 4.0 would be inherently incompatible with
those of CC-BY-SA 3.0, and the authors could not have avoided
this.</p>

<p>There are two approaches for avoiding the incompatibility problem
caused by different versions of copyleft licenses.</p>

<p>The FSF uses the approach of asking people to release programs under
&ldquo;GNU GPL version N or any later version.&rdquo;  This licensing is
compatible with version N, and also with N+1 (because it offers
version N+1 as an option).  When you combine code under &ldquo;GPL 3 or
later&rdquo; with code under &ldquo;GPL 2 or later,&rdquo; the license
of the combination is their intersection, which is &ldquo;GPL 3 or
later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We hope we will never need to make a GNU GPL version 4, but nothing is
perfect and we can't assume we have anticipated all the issues.  By
releasing your code under GNU GPL 3 or later, you permit your code to
upgrade to GNU GPL version 4 if we ever need one.</p>

<p>The other approach is to make each version of the license
explicitly allow upgrading to later versions.  The Mozilla Foundation
uses this approach, as does PHP.  Creative Commons, uses it for
CC-BY-SA: version 4.0 (the current version) explicitly permits any
user to upgrade to later versions of CC-BY-SA for modified works.</p>

<p>Only the GNU licenses give authors a choice about whether to permit
upgrades to future license versions.  When I wrote the first version
of the GNU GPL, in 1989, I considered including a license upgrade
option as is found now in CC licenses, but I thought it more correct
to give that choice to each author.  Thus, the author could release a
program either under &ldquo;GPL 1 only&rdquo; or &ldquo;GPL 1 or
later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since then, I have come to question the wisdom of that decision.
Programs such as Linux, which allow only one GNU GPL version and
reject license upgrades, cause practical
incompatibility.<a href="#f4">[4]</a>  If we ever make a GPL version
4, perhaps we should include an upgrade clause that automatically
permits relicensing to higher-numbered versions, 5 and up.</p>

<p>Some copyleft licenses allow cross-copyleft combinations with an
explicit relicensing clause giving permission to put the code under a
different copyleft license.  For instance, the CeCILL gives explicit
permission to relicense code to GNU GPL version 2 and later versions.
If program P is under the CeCILL, and you want to combine it with
program Q that's under GPL version 3 or later, the CeCILL says you can
do that and put the combination or merged code under GPL version 3 or
later.</p>

<p>Explicit relicensing permission is not the same thing as compatibility
(though relicensing code can make it compatible with other code) and
it is not symmetrical.  For instance, the CeCILL gives explicit
permission to relicense code to GNU GPL, but the GNU GPL does not
permit relicensing to the CeCILL.  Thus, you can't combine those two
programs P and Q and distribute the combination under the CeCILL; that
would violate the GPL in its use of program Q.  The only permitted way
to release that combined program is under the appropriate GPL
version(s).</p>

<p>Likewise, CC BY-SA 4.0 explicitly permits relicensing modified
versions to GNU GPL version 3, but GPL version 3 does not permit
relicensing to CC BY-SA.  This issue should never arise for software
code; Creative Commons says its licenses are not meant for code, and
says that the license to use for code is the GNU GPL.  But there are
other kinds of works, such as hardware designs or game art, where you
might have occasion to merge material released under CC-BY-SA with
material released under the GNU GPL.  This can be done through
CC BY-SA's explicit relicensing permission.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, CC BY-SA 4.0 does not permit relicensing to future GPL
versions.  What you should do, when you relicense material under
CC BY-SA 4.0 to the GPL, is <a
href="/licenses/rms-why-gplv3.html#future-proofing">specify
yourself as a license version proxy</a> to indicate whether future GPL
versions have been authorized for that material.  If someday there is
a GPL version 4 and Creative Commons decides to allow relicensing from
CC BY-SA to GPL version 4, you as proxy will be able to retroactively
authorize use of that relicensed material under GPL version 4.
(Alternatively, you can ask the authors of that material to give
permission right away.)</p>

<p>The ordinary GNU General Public License and the GNU Affero General
Public License are two different copyleft licenses, so they are
naturally incompatible.  We have set up a special kind of explicit
compatibility between them: you can include source code under the GNU
GPL version 3 together with other source code under the GNU Affero GPL
in a single combined program.  This is permitted because both of those
licenses explicitly say so, and the effect is that the GNU AGPL
applies to the combined program.  However, you can't simply relicense
code from the GNU GPL (with or without &ldquo;or later&rdquo;) to the
GNU Affero GPL, or vice versa; neither of these licenses gives
permission for that.  Note also that the GNU Affero GPL version 3 is
not a &ldquo;later version&rdquo; of the ordinary GNU GPL version 2,
because the GNU Affero GPL and the GNU GPL are two different series of
licenses.</p>

<p>The GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3, is really the GNU
General Public License version 3 plus some added extra permissions.
GPL version 3 (section 7) says you can always remove added
permissions, and by doing so you get the same code under the ordinary
GNU GPL version 3.  If a program permits use under GNU LGPL
version 3 or later, you can relicense it to GPL version 3 or later;
for each future GPL version N (N &gt; 3), we will make an LGPL version
N which consists of the GPL version N plus added permissions.</p>

<p>As for GNU Lesser GPL version 2.1, that explicitly permits relicensing
to GNU GPL version 2 or later.</p>

<p>Intermediate licenses are those which have substantive requirements
on redistribution but are not copyleft licenses.  Examples include the
Eclipse Public License and the Mozilla Public License.  Intermediate
licenses tend to be incompatible with any copyleft licenses because
their requirements don't permit the combined program to be under the
copyleft license.  The Mozilla Public License permits relicensing to
the GNU GPL except when the code explicitly denies this
permission.</p>

<p>Finally, what about dual licensing?<a href="#f5">[5]</a> A dual
license is a disjunction: it means that the same program carries a
choice of two or more different licenses.  For instance, older
versions of Perl carried a dual license: the disjunction of the
Artistic License and the GNU General Public License.  This meant that
each user could choose to use and redistribute Perl under one license
or the other, or under both in disjunction like the Perl release
itself.  A disjunction is compatible with a set of other licenses if
any one of the license choices in the disjunction is compatible with
that set.</p>

<p>When you choose a license for your code, please choose GNU GPL version
3 or later, or some license compatible with that.  This is the way to
make your code combinable with nearly all the corpus of free software.
Choosing GPL or AGPL, version 3 or later, will also do the utmost to
defend freedom for all users of all versions of your code.</p>

<h3 id="combining">Combining code</h3>

<p>When a set of licenses are compatible, that means you can legally
combine or merge a number of programs each licensed under one of those
licenses.  How, then, is the combined program licensed?</p>

<p>Each free software license says you must keep the license with the
code that is covered by it.  So in a strict sense, the licensing of
the combined program includes the licenses of all its parts.  However,
sometimes you want a <em>summary</em> answer to the question of how
the combined program is licensed.  Which licenses does someone using
the combined program <em>need to pay attention to?</em></p>

<p>To compute that, you start with a list of all the pertinent
licenses.  Then you can delete from the list any license which is
subsumed by another in the list.</p>

<p>We say that a license A <em>subsumes</em> license B when compliance with
license A implies compliance with license B.</p>

<p>For instance, the GNU GPL version N and the GNU Affero GPL version
N both subsume the GNU Lesser GPL version N, and all three of those
subsume the GNU Lesser GPL version 2.1.</p>

<p>Any GNU license, version N, subsumes the Apache 2.0 license provided
N is at least 3.</p>

<p>The GNU GPL, version N, subsumes all versions of the Mozilla Public
License that are compatible with it.</p>

<p>The Apache 2.0 license subsumes the BSD, Expat, X11, ISC and CC-0
licenses.  BSD 3 clause subsumes BSD 2 clause.  The BSD licenses
subsume the Expat, X11 and ISC licenses and CC0.</p>

<p>This is not meant to be a complete list, but if we are informed of
other cases worth mentioning, we will add them.</p>

<p>When some license is subsumed, you still need to include a copy
of it with all distribution of the combined program.</p>

<h3 id="footnotes" class="footnote">Footnotes</h3>
<ol>
<li id="f1"><p>It is not inconceivable that other legal issues
might arise about a specific combination of programs, issues not
related to the copyright licenses of the programs to be combined.  We
discuss only the implications of the licenses themselves.</p></li>

<li id="f2"><p>The main license in actual use that isn't
reasonably behaved is the license of TeX: if two programs are licensed
just the way TeX is, there is no authorized way to distribute a merged
version of them.</p>

<p>The TeX license permits distribution of a modified version only in
the form of the original version plus a differences file.  If A and B
are separately released that way, then merged, distributing the merged
program as A plus a change file violates the license of B.
Distributing this as B plus a change file violates the license of A.
Distributing this in any other way violates both licenses.</p>

<p>It is no coincidence that TeX was released in 1982: our community has
learned, since then, to write reasonably behaved licenses.</p>
</li>

<li id="f3"><p>When distributing in source code
form, it is usually sufficient to leave the license notices in the
source code as they stand; extra license notice requirements typically
only come up for lax licenses when distributing binaries without the
source code.</p></li>

<li id="f4"><p>In addition, GPL version 2 still allows
binaries to be made nonfree by hardware that rejects all but special
signed binaries, and still does not allow distribution of binaries by
torrent.  <a href="/licenses/rms-why-gplv3.html">We fixed those
problems, and others, in version 3</a>, but we can't change version 2.</p></li>

<li id="f5"><p>Some use the term &ldquo;dual licensing&rdquo;
to refer to selling exceptions, but that is a misnomer.
See <a href="/philosophy/selling-exceptions.html"> Selling
Exceptions</a>.  Note that if the program on which the license is sold
includes any code that is not in the free (libre) release, that's not
selling exceptions, that's nonfree software.</p></li>
