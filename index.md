### Overview

Bacon is a new Java CLI for [ProjectNCL](https://github.com/project-ncl/pnc) 2.0 combining features of the
older PNC CLI, [DependencyAnalysis](https://github.com/project-ncl/dependency-analysis) CLI and PiG tooling.

PiG (Product Files Generator) was introduced to automate the steps that don't require human
intervention. It provides tracking through holding the configuration within a YAML file stored within
a git repository. This simplified the productisation process and by automating it, the process was made
repeatable and less error prone. The process to create a product itself is complex with multiple
steps involved - for instance configuring PNC entities (products/projects/build configurations),
creating a maven repository, gathering licenses etc.

The PiG capabilities that have been merged into Bacon are:

* Create and update any PNC entities required. All the build configs involved are grouped into a build
group
* Trigger PNC builds
* Wait for the builds to finish
* Perform a release pushing builds to brew
* Generate maven repository zip in one of the following ways
  * from a bom file; generates a synthetic project based on a bom file produced by one of the builds
and gathers a repository containing all the artifacts required to build such project
  * based on build configs or the whole build group - with all the artifacts produced by the builds and
all the dependencies of the buildsy
  * from a repository generated by one of the builds - repackages the given repository and adds any
missing source jars, parent poms, checksums to it
* Generate license information - using [Licenses Generator](https://github.com/snowdrop/licenses-generator),
gather information from the artifact poms and license information exposed by the EAP team and create a properly formatted license zip
* Generate a source zip, a zip file containing sources of all the builds performed for the product
* Generate a javadoc zip with javadocs of all the projects that make a product
* Generate a CSV file listing all the artifacts in the repository along with info on their origin and whether
they are released to [MRRC](https://maven.repository.redhat.com/) or not. That's especially useful for preparing Cross Product Agreement
and Shared Content Request documents and identifying any artifacts that should not be used.


On top of the above, if needed, product-specific add-ons can be easily added and configured from
the same configuration file. Add-ons have access to information about the performed builds, artifacts they
created and consumed, can access the repository zip, etc. One example of an add-on is Quarkus community
dependency analysis add-on that checks for runtime community dependencies and provides information on
possible ways of eliminating them.


### Release Notes

For a list of changes please see [here](https://github.com/project-ncl/bacon/wiki/Changelog)

### Installation and Usage

Compile:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

Run after compilation:
```bash
java -jar cli/target/bacon.jar
```

Java JDK 11 is the minimum supported runtime. If you are installing Bacon on MacOs, please read the [pre-requiste section](#pre-requisite-for-macos). If you are running PNC internally with a company-signed TLS certificate, please read the [TLS certificate section](#tls-certificate)

To install the latest ***released*** version:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/project-ncl/bacon/main/bacon_install.py | python3 -
```

To install a specific ***released*** version:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/project-ncl/bacon/main/bacon_install.py | python3 - 2.0.1
```

To install the latest ***snapshot*** (no need to compile):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/project-ncl/bacon/main/bacon_install.py | python3 - snapshot
```

This will install the `bacon`, `pig`, `da` and `pnc` commands in the `~/bin`
directory, which on Linux will make it available in your shell.

To update the installed version:
```bash
# latest released version
bacon update

# specifc released version
bacon update 2.0.1

# snapshot version
bacon update snapshot
```

#### Pre-requisite for MacOs
1. Ensure `~/bin`  is added to your shell's $PATH, unlike Fedora this is not added by default. Depending on which shell you run you can add it by running:

```
# ZSH (Default as of macOs 10.15 Catalina)
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:${HOME}/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc

# BASH
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:${HOME}/bin"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

2. Ensure Python 3 is installed, this can be achieved using homebrew by running:
```
brew install python3
```

#### TLS Certificate
If PNC is deployed internally using a company-signed TLS certificate, The Java JDK will complain about using an untrusted certificate. We need to add the public key of the certificate to the Java truststore. There are a few ways to remedy this:

- When using the default JDK from your Linux distro, there might be a certificate rpm present that will add the company-signed TLS certificate to the Java truststore. The certificate rpm may not apply the TLS certificate to custom JDKs such as OracleJDK.
- If there is no such certificate rpm, the company public key can be added to the Java truststore using:
```
sudo keytool -import -alias <company>-<cert> -file <file of company public key.crt> -trustcacerts -storepass changeit --noprompt
```
