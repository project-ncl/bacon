### Overview

Bacon is a new Java CLI for [ProjectNCL](https://github.com/project-ncl/pnc) 2.0 combining features of the
older PNC CLI, [DependencyAnalysis](https://github.com/project-ncl/dependency-analysis) CLI and PiG tooling.

PiG (Product Files Generator) was introduced to automate the steps that don't require human
intervention. It provides tracking through holding the configuration within a YAML file stored within
a git repository. This simplified the productisation process and by automating it, the process was made
repeatable and less error prone. The process to create a product itself is complex with multiple
steps involved - for instance configuring PNC entities (products/projects/build configurations),
creating a maven repository, gathering licenses etc.

The PiG capabilities that have been merged into Bacon are:

* Create and update any PNC entities required. All the build configs involved are grouped into a build
group
* Trigger PNC builds
* Wait for the builds to finish
* Perform a release pushing builds to brew
* Generate maven repository zip in one of the following ways
  * from a bom file; generates a synthetic project based on a bom file produced by one of the builds
and gathers a repository containing all the artifacts required to build such project
  * based on build configs or the whole build group - with all the artifacts produced by the builds and
all the dependencies of the buildsy
  * from a repository generated by one of the builds - repackages the given repository and adds any
missing source jars, parent poms, checksums to it
* Generate license information - using [Licenses Generator](https://github.com/snowdrop/licenses-generator),
gather information from the artifact poms and license information exposed by the EAP team and create a properly formatted license zip
* Generate a source zip, a zip file containing sources of all the builds performed for the product
* Generate a javadoc zip with javadocs of all the projects that make a product
* Generate a CSV file listing all the artifacts in the repository along with info on their origin and whether
they are released to [MRRC](https://maven.repository.redhat.com/) or not. That's especially useful for preparing Cross Product Agreement
and Shared Content Request documents and identifying any artifacts that should not be used.


On top of the above, if needed, product-specific add-ons can be easily added and configured from
the same configuration file. Add-ons have access to information about the performed builds, artifacts they
created and consumed, can access the repository zip, etc. One example of an add-on is Quarkus community
dependency analysis add-on that checks for runtime community dependencies and provides information on
possible ways of eliminating them.
